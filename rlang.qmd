# R & RStudio

We will be using R via RStudio.  

## R: The Language

Released in 1993, R is an opensource successor to S, a commercially available statistical programming language developed at Bell Labs in the 1970s.  The history is not particularly relevant.  However, understanding that R was originally developed with the explicit goal of teaching introductory statistics (a bit like Matlab) may help to understand some of the design choices made by the developers of R.

There are several attributes that make R useful for teaching statistics:

- R is interpreted
- R is weakly typed
- R's the focus on data analysis is built into its native data types
- R has strong graphical abilities

There are also a variety of downsides to R, but we will try to sidestep these as much as we can.  One way we will do this is by exclusively using packages from the tidyverse.  Once you are familiar with one way of working in R, you can explore the many, many alternatives.


## RStudio

The interface between a programmer (or data analyst) and a programming language is often an integrate development environment (IDE), which is just a fancy term for a piece of software that collects a bunch of inter-related tools often useful when programming.  We will be using RStudio as our IDE.  As the name suggests, RStudio was designed as an R-first IDE, making things easy for those new to R and/or programming.

First time users often confuse R and RStudio. At its simplest, R is like a car's engine\index{R} while RStudio is like a car's dashboard\index{RStudio} as illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:R-vs-RStudio-1).

More precisely, R is the programming language that performs computations, whereas RStudio is how users interact with R.



## Installation

Installation involves two major steps.  The first step is to install R itself.  You can get the most recent version from CRAN (the comprehensive R archive network): https://cloud.r-project.org.  There are ready-made installers available for Linux, macOS, and Windows.

The second step is to install RStudio.  You can download it from Posit: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/.  Again, there are versions available for all major platforms.


## Using R via RStudio

Recall our car analogy from earlier. Much as we don't drive a car by interacting directly with the engine but rather by interacting with elements on the car's dashboard, we won't be using R directly but rather we will use RStudio's interface. After you install R and RStudio on your computer, you'll have two new *programs* or *applications* you can open. We'll always work in RStudio and not in the R application. Figure \@ref(fig:R-vs-RStudio-2) shows what icon you should be clicking on your computer. 


![Icons of R versus RStudio on your computer.](images/logos/R_vs_RStudio.png)


After you open RStudio, you should see something similar to Figure \@ref(fig:RStudio-interface). (Note that slight differences might exist if the RStudio interface is updated after 2019 to not be this by default.)

Note the three *panes* dividing the screen: the *console pane*, the *files pane*, and the *environment pane*.  The console pane is where you enter R commands and R returns the corresponding results (and/or error messages if you make a mistake).  We'll dig into the other panes a bit more later.


## Other Packages

One of the main strengths of R (arguably the most important strength) is the availability of many, many packages (or libraries) that extend the functionality of R in all sort of different ways. These libraries are written by a worldwide community of R users and can be downloaded for free.  We will rely on a variety of these packages, so we take a moment now to discuss how packages work in R and RStudio.

A good analogy for R packages is they are like apps you can download onto your mobile phone.  So R is like a new mobile phone: while it has a certain amount of features when you use it for the first time, it doesn’t have everything. R packages are like the apps you can download onto your phone from Apple’s App Store or Android’s Google Play.

Let's continue this analogy by considering the Instagram app for editing and sharing pictures. Say you have purchased a new phone and you would like to share a photo you have just taken with friends on Instagram. You need to:

1. *Install the app*: Since your phone is new and does not include the Instagram app, you need to download the app from either the App Store or Google Play. You do this once and you're set for the time being. You might need to do this again in the future when there is an update to the app.
1. *Open the app*: After you've installed Instagram, you need to open it.

Once Instagram is open on your phone, you can then proceed to share your photo with your friends and family. The process is very similar for using an R package. You need to:

1. *Install the package*: This is like installing an app on your phone. Most packages are not installed by default when you install R and RStudio. Thus, if you want to use a package, you need to install it first. Once you've installed a package, you likely won't install it again unless you want to update it to a newer version.
1. *"Load" the package*: "Loading" a package is like opening an app on your phone. Packages are not "loaded" by default when you start RStudio on your computer; you need to "load" each package you want to use every time you start RStudio.

Let's take a look at how these two steps come together to install and load the `ggplot2` package for data visualization.

### Package Installation

There are two ways to install an R package: an easy way and a more advanced way. \index{R packages!installation} Let's install the `ggplot2` package the easy way first as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:easy-way-install). In the Files pane of RStudio:

a) Click on the "Packages" tab.
a) Click on "Install" next to Update.
a) Type the name of the package under "Packages (separate multiple with space or comma):" In this case, type `ggplot2`.
a) Click "Install."

An alternative but slightly less convenient way to install a package is by typing `install.packages("ggplot2")` in the console pane of RStudio and pressing Return/Enter on your keyboard. Note you must include the quotation marks around the name of the package.

Much like an app on your phone, you only have to install a package once. However, if you want to **update** a previously installed package to a newer version, you need to reinstall it by repeating the earlier steps.

### Package Loading

Recall that after you've installed a package, you need to "load it." In other words, you need to "open it." We do this by using the `library()` command. \index{R packages!loading} 

For example, to load the `ggplot2` package, run the following code in the console pane. What do we mean by "run the following code"? Either type or copy-and-paste the following code into the console pane and then hit the Enter key. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
```

If after running the earlier code, a blinking cursor returns next to the `>` "prompt" sign, it means you were successful and the `ggplot2` package is now loaded and ready to use. If, however, you get a red "error message" that reads `...` \index{R packages!loading error}

```
Error in library(ggplot2) : there is no package called ‘ggplot2’
```

`...` it means that you didn't successfully install it. This is an example of an "error message" we discussed in Subsection \@ref(messages). If you get this error message, go back to Subsection \@ref(package-installation) on R package installation and make sure to install the `ggplot2` package before proceeding.

### Package Use {#package-use}

One very common mistake new R users make when wanting to use particular packages is they forget to "load" them first by using the `library()` command we just saw. Remember: *you have to load each package you want to use every time you start RStudio.* If you don't first "load" a package, but attempt to use one of its features, you'll see an error message similar to:

```
Error: could not find function
```

This is a different error message than the one you just saw on a package not having been installed yet. R is telling you that you are trying to use a function in a package that has not yet been "loaded." R doesn't know where to find the function you are using. Almost all new users forget to do this when starting out, and it is a little annoying to get used to doing it. However, you'll remember with practice and after some time it will become second nature for you.
